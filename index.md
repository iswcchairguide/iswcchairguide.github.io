# Congratulations on being General Chair of ISWC\!

The aim of this guide is to aid in the running of the conference, and to pass on best practice.  Therefore it should be seen as a living (evolving) document to aid future chairs\! Although the guide is not meant to be a complete step-by-step instruction manual, it has been reorganised to provde direction and advice regarding the different aspects of the conference organisation, including a summary of things that might not be obvious, or that you should watch out for.

The guide has been structured to cover the differet phases and activities, and is not meant to be prescriptive.  Each section includes a list of *notes, tips and resources* that shoudl be updated each year, to ensure that the guide is always up to date and is useful.
