# Congratulations on being (invited to be) General Chair of ISWC\!

This is a guide to help as it’s something each of us will do once, so it’s good to pass on experiences from year to year. Please add to this for future chairs\! Note that the document is not meant to be a complete step-by-step guide, but rather a summary of things that might not be obvious, or that you should watch out for. Conversely, of course, you can always set your own path; these are tips/recommendations.
