## Leading up to the conference

* In the couple of months prior to the conference, there will be a lot of work for the Web Chairs adding details of accepted papers, PC, programme, etc., to the website, as well as sending messages out via social media. It might be worth preparing them for this (and of course, trying to get as much as possible on the website as early as possible).   
  * **TIP**: With more details fixed (keynotes, panels, etc.), it is also a good time to try to encourage local attendees to attend. A nice-looking brochure with key selling points of the conference to be sent on local mailing lists is a good approach.  
* Double-check that all is going well with the sponsors (perks are being met), with the student travel grants, etc. Basically check through all OC roles to ensure the final preparations are in place.  
* Keep an eye on workshops to check attendees, and cross-check with W\&T chairs that all events will go ahead, and their duration. Otherwise this may require re-planning.  
* Figure out with all track chairs a strategy for no-shows. Note that while authors may reach out in advance, some might only be “no-shows” on that day.  
* Chat with the Local Chairs to review details of the local venue. Make sure it will be clear (via obvious signs) what sessions are in which place, and how to get there. Also be sure to double-check that nothing critical depends on one particular student volunteer, and if they have a key role, that they will be given some sort of instructions or induction. And be sure that sponsor logos will be presented appropriately at the start of keynotes, etc  
  * **TIP**: Companies are picky about how their logos are used: for example, they want particular logos, their permission to display logos needs to be sought, they might ask for promo material, they don’t like their logos on anything disposable, etc. Be sure to check with them how their logo will be used\!  
* Check also with Local Chairs what will be given to attendees: a bag, a programme, etc.  
  * **TIP**: Something many people at ISWC 2024 appreciated was having printed programmes. Aside from that, a lanyard, a badge, wifi details if needed, there is not much need for anything else (a nice tote bag is okay, but many of us already have dozens of these).  
* From experience, it may also be worth checking with the Local Chairs that the conference venue is not double-booked with a wedding.  
* About a month before the conference is a good opportunity to start to think about Opening Ceremony slides, Closing Ceremony slides, and Town Hall. This requires a lot of coordination between you, SWSA, the Local Chairs, the Track Chairs, and next year’s General/Local Chairs, so it’s good to start quite early. Figure out who presents what.  
  * **TIP**: Google slides is very useful for collaboratively editing the slides.  
* Also about a month before the conference is a good time to assign Session Chairs for everything, from keynotes, to main tracks, etc. Keynotes are typically chaired by Research Chairs, a Local Chair, yourself, etc. Other track chairs, SPC, etc., can be invited to chair Main Track sessions. Be sure to send them instructions on how to chair the session (arrive W minutes before, talks are X minutes \+ Y minutes Q\&A, what to do if they cannot make it, what to do if there is a no-show, etc.).  
* Ensure that all accepted papers are available via the homepage prior to the conference.  
* Also double-check that all papers have an author registered, and follow-up if necessary.  
* Put together a [design for award certificates](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10LhO02k-xY54cG5e1I7ppzwdtoRGSPmP/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107368889730418788483&rtpof=true&sd=true) and coordinate with Track Chairs to have possible awards that will be needed ready to print. Think also about who will be able to sign them, and when (if the corresponding Track Chairs don’t go, the General Chair can sign).  
* Prepare for those who cannot attend or don’t show: request videos, slides, remote connection, etc.
