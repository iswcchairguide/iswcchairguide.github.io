# Roles and Responsibilities within the Organising Committee 

## Prior to the previous ISWC

* You’ll probably have been invited two years prior to the conference date. You may or may not need to wait to find out where the conference will be held, when, and the Local Chairs, all of which will be decided by SWSA. It would be good to chat with the Local Chairs to see what roles each one will take on.  
* SWSA has a set of documents that include an official guide for General Chairs, past statistics for ISWC, etc. For example, the [General Chair guide is here](https://swsa.semanticweb.org/private/guide-iswc-conference-chairs). In case this was not shared with you, you may need to contact SWSA to solicit an account (Ian Horrocks seems to manage the logins, at least as of 2024).  
* Your first concrete goal will be to have your full OC invited and accepted in anticipation of the ISWC being held the year before the one in which you will GC (henceforth: prior ISWC). You can start this once you know when and where (city) the conference will be held so OC invitees can decide if they will be able to attend or not. Diversity is important for the OC (gender, geographical, etc.). SWSA like to validate beforehand who you intend to invite to the chairs of the main tracks (Research, Resources, In-Use) so be sure to reach out to let them know who you intend to invite for these roles.  
  * **TIP**: It’s also important to note that people who are invited may not reply, may say no, etc. And the OC is large\! So start this process several months in advance of the prior ISWC being held.  
  * **TIP**: If you want to avoid repeat roles, you might find the [following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169mThBN6U09JvH_cILnV5rih2WIJz3kClfV4kXJeick/edit?gid=0#gid=0) useful. (And please extend it for future years.)  
* The Local Chairs should also have the homepage up with the OC and conference dates before the prior ISWC. Stefan Decker controls the semanticweb.org domain, so once you have an IP, get the local organisers to send it to Stefan to create an A-Record.  
  * **TIP**: Getting the website, domain, logo, banner, etc., ready can take time so this process should be started several months prior to the previous ISWC. The website is crucial and getting it up early is very *very* important\!  
  * **TIP**: In ISWC 2024, the Local Chairs decided to hire a company to manage the website. This created significant delays as the company had certain policies and processes in place (e.g., 3 weeks to set up a custom domain). Be wary of this decision. Getting a couple of trustworthy, responsive PhDs or Postdocs to manage a WordPress instance or lightweight solution will be a lot more agile.
