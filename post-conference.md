## Post-conference

* A week or two after the conference, prepare to present an overview of the conference (along with Local Chairs) to SWSA online.  
* There will probably be still a few loose-ends waiting to be tied up, such as attendees who need documentation to claim expenses, award payments that need to be fulfilled, etc. But these details tend to be relatively minor.  
* Enjoy some hobbies, friends, family, etc.
