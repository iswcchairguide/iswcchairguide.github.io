## During/shortly after the prior ISWC

* Attending the prior ISWC is highly recommended as future GC, but not essential. It is highly recommended in order to tune into the Town Hall, OC Lunch, to chat with current and future OC, etc. You need to invite the OC attending ISWC to the OC Lunch (typically on the last day). You also need to coordinate with the Local Chairs (and SWSA) to ensure that the next ISWC is presented at the conference conclusion, along with the OC.  
  * **TIP**: The OC lunch is very useful, but it has limited bandwidth to get into details on specific tracks, and also not all OC (in particular future OC) can attend. It is thus useful to request/push your chairs to organise a video call with their corresponding chairs from the prior ISWC in order to get into more detail on feedback, tips, material to hand over, etc. Be sure to also organise a chat with the previous ISWC GC. If using EasyChair, you will need them to eventually export settings. Also it’s good to chat about potential complications, tips, etc.  
* The week after the prior ISWC, you can expect SWSA to organise a meeting with present and future ISWC Local and General Chairs. As GC, you can present the OC, some goals for the conference you have, etc. About a 5-10 minute talk. (GC and LCs of prior ISWC will present just before you.)
